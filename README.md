# fuckCheaters

## OLD STUFF

got fed up with cheaters in CoD:MW(2019) and WZ so i made this thing
it grabs a screenshot of a predefined area (the banner with nickname, showing up after getting killed), runs it through OCR and tries to search a website that has statistics, collecting K/D ratio and headshot %. it then uses tts to inform the user about that player, all without the need to minimize the game, all using a simple shortcut
